/*
 * Description: Exception Handling - Try with Resources Statement
 * Note
 * 1. This feature is available from Java 1.7 onwards.
 * 2. The try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is an object
 *    that must be closed after the program is finished with it. The try-with-resources statement ensures that each
 *    resource is closed at the end of the statement. Any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which
 *    includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable, can be used as a resource.
