/*
 * Description: Method Overloading
 * Note
 * 1. Overloaded methods are differentiated by the number and the type of the arguments passed into the method.
 * 2. There cannot be more than one method with the same name and the same number and type of arguments,
 * 3. Overloaded methods should be used sparingly, as they can make code much less readable.
