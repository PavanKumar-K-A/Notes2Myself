/*
 * Description: Interfaces Variables in Java
 * Note
 * 1. You can use interfaces to import shared constants into multiple classes by simply declaring an interface that
 *    contains variables which are initialised to the desired values. When you include that interface in a class (that
 *    is, when you "implement" the interface), all of those variable names will be in scope as constants. This is
 *    similar to using a header file in C/C++ to create a large number of #defined constants or const declarations.
 * 2. If an interface contains no methods, then any class that includes such an interface doesn't actually implement
 *    anything. It is as if that class were importing the constant variables into the class name space as final
 *    variables.
