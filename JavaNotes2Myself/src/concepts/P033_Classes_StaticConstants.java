 * Description: Constants in Java
 * Note
 * 1. The static modifier, along with final modifier, is also used to define constants.
 * 2. The final modifier indicates that the value of this field cannot change.
 * 3. Constants defined in this way cannot be reassigned.
 * 4. By convention, the names of constant values are spelled in uppercase letters. If the name is composed of more
 *    than one word, the words are separated by an underscore (_).
