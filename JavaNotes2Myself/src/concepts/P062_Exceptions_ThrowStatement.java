/*
 * Description: Exception Handling - Throw an Exception
 * Note
 * 1. Sometime instead of handling all exceptions, it makes more sense to throw those exception to be handled by other
 *    stack methods. In such cases, add a throws clause to the method declaration.
 * 2. Two keywords throw and throws are used to for throwing an exception.
