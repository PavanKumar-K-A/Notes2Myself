/*
 * Description: Final Variable, Final Methods and Final Class in Java
 * Note
 * 1. Final Variable
 *      - It prevents its contents from being modified.
 * 2. Final Methods
 *      - It prevents its contents from being overridden.
 *      - Methods called from constructors should generally be declared final. If a constructor calls a non-final
 *        method, a subclass may redefine that method with surprising or undesirable results.
 * 3. Final Class
 *      - It prevents its contents from being inherited.
 * 4. Final Arguments
 *      - Arguments cannot be modified within the method.
 * 5. Blank final (static final and field final).
 *      - TODO
