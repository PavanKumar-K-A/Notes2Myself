"""
Note
1. This implementation generates all prime numbers between 1 and N using Optimised Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm.
2. Optimisation(s)
    - Instead of testing for all multiples of n, it is sufficient to mark the numbers in starting from n^2, as all the
      smaller multiples of n would have already been marked at that point. This means that the algorithm is allowed to
      terminate when n^2 is greater than LIMIT.
    - Another refinement is to initially list odd numbers only, (3, 5, ..., n), and count in increments of 2p in step 3,
      thus marking only odd multiples of p.
3. Limitation(s)
    - This implementation SHOULD NOT BE TRIED WITH A NUMBER GREATER THAN 100 Million.
