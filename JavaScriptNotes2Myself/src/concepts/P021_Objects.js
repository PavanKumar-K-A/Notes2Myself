// Description: Objects in JavaScript

// Objects
// 1. Object: An object is a collection of mutable properties.
// 2. Property: A property is a pair consisting of a NAME and a VALUE.
// 3. Name: A property name can be any string, including an empty string.
// 4. Value: A property value can be any JavaScript value except 'undefined'.

// JavaScript Objects
// 1. Everything in JavaScript is an Object - String, Number, Array, Functions etc.
// 2. Objects in JavaScript are class-free.

// Immutable Objects
// 1. Objects that CANNOT be modified after it has been created are called immutable objects.
// 2. Numbers, strings and booleans are IMMUTABLE objects.

// Mutable Objects
// 1. An object whose properties can be modified are called mutable objects.
// 2. Arrays, functions, regular expressions etc are MUTABLE objects.

// Methods
// 1. Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
// 2. Object can have Methods.

// Prototype Linkage
// 1. JavaScript includes a prototype linkage feature that allows an object to inherit the properties of
//    another object. This can significantly reduce object initialisation time and memory consumption.

// An example of an immutable string object
var name = "Messi";
console.log("Property Length:", name.length);
console.log("Method toUpperCase():", name.toUpperCase());
