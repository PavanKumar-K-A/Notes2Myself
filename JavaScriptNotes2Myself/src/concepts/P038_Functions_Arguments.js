// Description: Function Arguments in JavaScript

// 1. A bonus parameter that is available to functions when they are invoked is the 'arguments' array. It gives the
//    function access to all of the arguments that were supplied with the invocation, including excess arguments that
//    were not assigned to parameters. This makes it possible to write functions that take an unspecified number of
//    parameters.
// 2. CAUTION:
//      - Because of a design error, arguments is not really an array. It is an array-like object.
//      - Arguments has a length property, but it lacks all of the array methods.
//      - This is not a particularly useful pattern.

// Example of a function that adds a lot of stuff.
// Note: Defining the variable sum inside of the function does not interfere with the sum defined outside of the
// function. The function only sees the inner one.

var sum = function() {
    var i, sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i += 1) {
        sum += arguments[i];
    }
    return sum;
};

var result = sum(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42);
console.log(result); // 108
