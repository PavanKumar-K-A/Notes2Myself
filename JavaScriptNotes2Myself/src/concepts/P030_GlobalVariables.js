// Description: Global Variables in JavaScript

// 1. JavaScript supports defining and using global variables that can hold all the assets of an application.
//    Unfortunately, global variables weaken the resiliency of programs and should be AVOIDED.
// 2. One way to minimize the use of global variables is to create a single global variable for an
//    application. By reducing your global footprint to a single name, you significantly reduce the chance of
//    bad interactions with other applications, widgets or libraries. Program are easier to read because it is
//    obvious that MYAPP.person refers to a top-level structure.
// 3. Another effective global abatement technique is to use closure for information hiding.

// This variable becomes the container of an application
var MYAPP = {};

// Add a person object
MYAPP.person = {
    firstname   : "Lionel",
    lastname    : "Messi"
};

// Add an array of clubs
MYAPP.clubs = [ 'Barcelona', 'Manchaster United', 'Real Madrid' ];

console.log(MYAPP);
