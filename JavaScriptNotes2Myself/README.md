About Project
=============
JavaScriptNotes2Myself is a collection of code snippets that I created while I was learning JavaScript. As my 
learning progressed, I converted these code snippets into independent examples with enough notes that is 
readily available for reference.

I started my JavaScript journey with the book 'JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglous Crockford' and I added 
more examples and notes from my own experience with JavaScript.

This project also include a list of good and recommended books on JavaScript, a list of social media 
communities for latest JavaScript news and a list of URLs like video playlist for various JavaScript topics.
