# Description: rsync - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool

# Notes
# 1. Use grsync tool for a GUI based rsync. Install it using sudo apt-get install grsync.
# 2. Never run rsync without using the --dry-run option first. Only after you have completed several safe runs and
#    verified no undesired files are copied, desired files are deleted, nothing is missing, and nothing has been
#    modified without your consent, only then should you try copying files in earnest.
# 3. Supports copying links, devices, owners, groups and permissions.
# 4. Itâ€™s faster than scp (Secure Copy) because rsync uses remote-update protocol which allows to transfer just
#    the differences between two sets of files. First time, it copies the whole content of a file or a directory
#    from source to destination but from next time, it copies only the changed blocks and bytes to the destination.
# 5. Rsync consumes less bandwidth as it uses compression and decompression method while sending and receiving data both
#    ends.

# Common Examples
rsync -avs --delete --dry-run -i dir1/ backup/
rsync -avs --delete -i dir1/ backup/

# Examples with details
rsync -avs dir1/ backup/                                            # General syntax is rsync FLAGS/OPTIONS SRC DEST
                                                                    # Use -a flag for all objects, -v for verbose output
                                                                    # and -s for not allowing remote shell to interpret
                                                                    # characters. The -s flag means file names with
                                                                    # spaces and special characters will not be
