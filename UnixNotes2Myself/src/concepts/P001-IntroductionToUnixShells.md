# Description: Introduction To Unix Shell Script

1. The shell provides an interface to the UNIX system or kernel.
2. The shell takes the user inputs, pre-processes the inputs, executes the script based on the processed inputs and
   displays the output.
3. There are 2 types of shell
   A. The Bourne shell: The default prompt is the $ character.
      - Bourne shell (sh)
      - Korn shell (ksh)
      - Bourne Again shell (bash)
      - POSIX shell (sh)
   B. The C shell: The default prompt is the % character.
      - C shell (csh)
      - TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)
4. The Bourne shell was the first shell to appear on UNIX systems and is often referred to as **"The shell"**. The
   Bourne shell is usually installed as /bin/sh on most versions of UNIX.
