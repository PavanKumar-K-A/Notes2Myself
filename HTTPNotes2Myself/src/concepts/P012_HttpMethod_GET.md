# Description: HTTP Operation - GET

### The HTTP GET Method
- The GET operation is a simple two-message exchange.
- The client initiates an HTTP Request to the server & specifies the GET operation as part of HTTP Request message.
- The GET message includes a request for an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
- The client can optionally include one or more HTTP parameters (key-value pair) to the server.
- The server returns an HTTP Response message consisting of HTTP Status Code, HTTP Response Header and an optional HTTP Response body.
- The server sends a status code of 200 OK for a successful HTTP Response or sends one of the many error status codes.

### Connect to an HTTP Server on port 80 using any telnet client.
```
telnet www.posttestserver.com 80
```

### Send an HTTP Request message to the server.
```
---

- For clarity, the beginning & end of HTTP message is marked with '---' above but it is NOT a part of actual HTTP message protocol.
